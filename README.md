In this README file I will briefly explain what I will be doing in this project. After creating a directory on github, which I am still not sure what actually means, I will put my HTML skills to the test. This probably includes making links, making lists, organized and unorganized, maybe som pictures as well. We'll see. It will probably look like shit until I get to the CSS part.
